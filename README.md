## Hybrid Variational Autoencoders
This repository implements Hybrid Variational Autoencoders (HVAEs), generative models tested on various data types including images, text, and multimodal datasets. HVAEs combine the benefits of Variational Autoencoders and latent variable models to effectively handle heterogeneous data.

## Features

- Supports multiple data types: continuous and discrete
- Flexible architecture for diverse datasets
- Pre-trained models available for benchmark datasets

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hybrid-variational-autoencoders.git
cd hybrid-variational-autoencoders
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train a Hybrid Variational Autoencoder, run:

```bash
python train.py --dataset <your_dataset_name> --epochs <number_of_epochs>
```

Replace `<your_dataset_name>` and `<number_of_epochs>` with your chosen dataset and desired training epochs.

## Datasets

Tested datasets include:
- Image Dataset From
